# Moe Adham

I, Moe Adham, hereby nominate myself for the Zcash Foundation Board of Directors.

## Motivation

I feel that privacy centric payment solutions are in short supply, and under active threat of censorship. I feel my industry knowledge and relationships might help steer the foundation with a long-term goal of ensuring privacy is never at risk.

## Goals for the Foundation

The Zcash foundation has done a commendable job to date, and I am very thankful for their stewardship. The stated mission of the foundation to ensure this project remain always a tool for financial privacy available to the general public is a noble one.

I am hoping to assist the foundation in areas in which I am expert. These Include:

- Academic research efforts of ZK systems
- Enabling wider adoption of Zcash while maintaining privacy, specifically with respect to client implementations and support

## My Background/CV

I founded Bitaccess.ca in 2013. We are one of the largest Bitcoin ATM producers in the world. Privacy has always been one of our core values. Through this work, I have witnessed a rather startling effort by the industry to monitor and de-anonymise the bitcoin network. I have unique insights into the specific models institutions and governments are utilizing to reduce privacy on public blockchain networks. It is for this reason that I am interested in ensuring that systems such as Zcash remain laser focused on privacy.

Before founding Bitaccess, I obtained a Masters of Nanotechnology from the Swiss Institute of Technology. I'm quite well versed in all subjects related to chip design/ASIC technology. I got my start in Bitcoin by mining Bitcoins using FPGA's (VHDL) I had access to at EPFL in 2011. I have a very good idea of what makes an algorithm ASIC resistant, for example.

I am also the Cheif Investment Officer of [Cypherpunk Holdings](https://www.cypherpunkhodlings.com/). Cypherpunk Holdings is a [publicly traded investment company](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2018-06-11/khan-resources-announces-executive-and-board-additions-and-a-proposed-name-change-to-cypherpunk-holdings-inc) in Canada. Our investment thesis remains that networks that provide strong decentalization and strong privacy will be the most valuable over the long term. We invest funds accordingly. 

I hope to assist the board in technical related subjects. These would include threat modelling and appropriate responses (ex. nation states, miners, forks, etc). I would also like to augment relationships with the academic community to ensure empirical research continues on the privacy modelling of the Zcash protocol.

At Bitaccess, we've built a pretty great access point for cryptocurrencies through our BTM product, as well as our private exchange https://faa.st. I speak frequently at conferences in North america and europe, with a special focus on academic and governmental issues.

We also do a good amount of work with Governments to increase transparency and auditability https://explorecatena.com. Through this work, I am able to gain unique insight into methods and models which governments are using to regulate and monitor public blockchain networks.
