# Moe Adham

I, Moe Adham, hereby nominate myself for the Zcash Foundation Board of Directors.

## Motivation

I feel that privacy centric payment solutions are in short supply, and under active threat of censorship. I feel my industry knowledge and relationships might help steer the foundation with a long-term goal of ensuring privacy is never at risk.

## Goals for the Foundation

To encourage development of wallet and node implementations/upgrades that preserve privacy, but allow for larger market adoption.

## My Background/CV

I founded Bitaccess.ca in 2013. We are one of the largest Bitcoin ATM producers in the world. Privacy has always been one of our core values.

Before founding Bitaccess, I obtained a Masters of Nanotechnology from the Swiss Institute of Technology. I'm quite well versed in all subjects related to chip design/ASIC technology. I got my start in Bitcoin by mining Bitcoins using FPGA's (VHDL) I had access to at EPFL in 2011. I have a very good idea of what makes an algorithm ASIC resistant, for example.

At Bitaccess, we've built a pretty great access point for cryptocurrencies through our BTM product, as well as our private exchange https://faa.st. 

We also do a good amount of work with Governments to increase transparency and auditability: https://explorecatena.com
