# Ballot Proposal: The Official Zcash Taxes are improved

Proposed ballot entry:

```
Dev tax range from 20% to 2020 each year to break all of these. Annually 10% 2019 5% Each year 2020 2,5% 2021 1,25% 2022 0,625% 2023 2024 is 0,625%. why? 210.000 has been completed.
```

## Point-Counterpoint on Each Choice

As we all know, 20% is a large amount of terminal tax. At the beginning of the economy in 2019, more taxes were levied on more people. Dev had an excellent ZEC team so he could extend all 210.000 ZECs. Both sides of the exhibition and Dev ZEC did not pump and dump at 2020.

I am very sorry for the bad English. I hope this plan will work.
