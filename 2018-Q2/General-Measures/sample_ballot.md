# Ballot Proposal: The Official Zcash Mascot

Proposed ballot entry:

```
The Foundation should endeavor to establish the official Zcash mascot as one of the following choices:

- Zeal, a collection of Zebras
- Waterbear
- Squirrel
- Axolotl
- A Talking Horse
```

## Point-Counterpoint on Each Choice

### Zeal

Pro: Many mascots are better than one, and it's a collection of Zebras. Speaks to strength in numbers.
Con: Some people don't like zebras.

### Waterbear

Pro: Practically indestructible.
Con: Some people don't like waterbears.

### Squirrel

Pro: Cute.
Con: Some people don't like squirrels.

### Axolotl

Pro: Also cute, but weirdly human-looking.
Con: Some people don't like axolotls.

### A Talking Horse

Pro: Could repurpose a lot of old TV once it goes into the public domain.
Con: Some people don't like talking horses.

*note: a real ballot can/should be longer than this*
