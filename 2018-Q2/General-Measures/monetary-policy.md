# Ballot Proposal: Zcash Foundation on Monetary Policy

Proposed ballot entry:

```
The Foundation should be open to discussing changes to monetary policy and/or supply schedule.

- Agree
- Disagree
```

## Point-Counterpoint on Each Choice

As we all know, 20% is a large amount of terminal tax. At the beginning of the economy in 2019, more taxes were levied on more people. Dev had an excellent ZEC team so he could extend all 210.000 ZECs. Both sides of the exhibition and Dev ZEC did not pump and dump at 2020.

I am very sorry for the bad English. I hope this plan will work.
