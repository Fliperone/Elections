# Proposed Ballot Measure:  Serving Zcash users by focusing on the Zcash blockchain and responsible chain forks thereof

## Proposal Text

Any significant effort by the Foundation to develop or promote a cryptocurrency shall be directed at either the (1) Zcash blockchain; or (2) chain forks (chain splits) of the Zcash blockchain that approximately carry forward the percentage stakes of Zcash holders immediately before the fork (split) to the money supply in circulation immediately after the fork (split).

- Agree
- Disagree


## Motivation

### Introduction
As part of a [discussion about foundation governance](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/56), Zooko raised several questions relating to the ["where the bounds of the Zcash Foundation's authority lie."](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/56#issuecomment-357319825). This ballot proposal attempts to answers some of those questions by establishing that:

1. The foundation's focus should remain on the current Zcash blockchain and future chain forks of that blockchain.
2. It is appropriate for the Foundation to consider developing or promoting chain forks (chain splits) of the Zcash blockchain.
3. It is inappropriate for the Foundation to commit significant resources to developing or promoting blockchains other than the current Zcash blockchain or chain forks (chain splits) of the current Zcash blockchain.
4. If the Foundation does develop or promote a chain fork (chain split) of the current Zcash blockchain, it should carry forward the percentage stakes of Zcash holders at the time of the fork (split).

### The Zcash Foundation serves users of the Zcash blockchain

Since its inception, the Foundation has stated several times that its serves users of the Zcash blockchain:


> Our mission, most broadly, is to serve the Zcash community and the general public as users of the Zcash protocol and blockchain.
> ([First Announcement from the Zcash Foundation](https://z.cash.foundation//blog/hello-world/), March 7, 2017 (emphasis added))

> [O]ur mission is to be a public charity dedicated to building Internet payment and privacy infrastructure for the public good, ___primarily serving the users of the Zcash protocol and blockchain___.
> ([Zcash Foundation Mission Statement](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/blob/master/MISSION.md), lasted edited April 9, 2018 (emphasis added))

Scientific research and open source software development funded by the Foundation is likely to benefit other blockchains as well as the Zcash blockchain. For example, to the extent that the Foundation's work improves the Zcash protocol, other blockchains that use the protocol (like ZClassic, ZenCash, and Bitcoin Private) will benefit.  But the central focus should remain on the Zcash blockchain.

Note that this ballot measure is not meant to preclude grant proposals like the currently proposed [$10,000 contribution to Monero's Forum Funding System (FFS)](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues/17). In the language of the ballot measure, $10,000 would not rise to the level of "significant effort."

### In order to best serve users of the Zcash blockchain, it is essential for the foundation to have the ability to successfully execute a chain fork

As Zooko recently stated:

> In cryptocurrency governance, your negotiating power is equal to the credibility of the threat that you could execute a successful hard fork.
> ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/999735875947790336), May 24, 2018)

The Foundation was designed from the beginning to be independent of the Zcash Company. If the Company goes astray in the future and fails to best serve users of the Zcash blockchain, the Foundation should consider developing and promoting a chain fork.

### With respect to chain forks, current users of the Zcash blockchain are best served by chain forks that preserve each user's percentage stake 

Many users have expended significant resources to obtain a ZEC stake, either through mining ZEC, purchasing ZEC from an exchange, or earning ZEC by selling goods or services. A Foundation-backed chain fork should respect current ZEC holders by preserving each user's percentage stake at the time of the fork.
